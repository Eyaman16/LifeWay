# LifeWay

### An application aiming to demolish poverty with innovative solutions.

#### 

## Overview

We all deserve to live our lives with our dreams and our freedom. Let's not repeat to ourselves constantly that we want a life that is worth living. There are those who don't repeat it they just try to keep breathing and living despite themselves
That's why the life way will be an opportunity for me, for you, and for all of us. Our app will be the link between those who want to donate and those in need, as well as charitable organizations
By simply registering your account in the app, you can donate whatever you want: food, clothes, money, and even books.The organizations will take it from you and guarantee its arrival to those in need. The same goes for the job opportunities section for those in need
The app will also have a volunteering section to give you the opportunity to work with charitable organizations to help
The most important thing to ensure the honesty of the app is the chat between the donor and the organizations specifically between them only to know the details of the donations
With our app, we will put an end to the problem of poverty and reduce it. No one deserves to suffer and die without having the opportunity to dream.
